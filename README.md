# citation-schemes

This repository contains a concordance between the two citation schemes used for referring to the text of the *Deipnosophists*:

* Casaubon citation-scheme - this system dates back to the edition of the *Deipnosophists* by Isaac Casaubon (1597): the scheme follows the pagination of the edition with an arabic numeral referring to the page followed by a letter (ranging from a to f) corresponding to the subdivion of the page into paragraphs of about ten lines each (e.g., *Deipn*. 15.683b).
* Kaibel citation-scheme - this system was introduced by Georg Kaibel (1887): each book is logically divided into paragraphs corresponding to units of sense and the paragraphs are referred to with arabic numerals whose numeration starts again at the
beginning of each book (e.g., *Deipn*. 12.40).
