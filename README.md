This repository of the [Digital Athenaeus](http://www.digitalathenaeus.org) project contains a concordance between the numerations used in the two editions of the 15 books of the *Deipnosophists* of Athenaeus of Naucratis by Isaac Casaubon and Georg Kaibel:

* Casaubon reference system - this system dates back to the edition of the *Deipnosophists* by [Isaac Casaubon (1597)](http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/3883/10/athenai-ou-deipnosophiston-biblia-pentekai-deka-athenaei-deipnosophistarum-libri-xv/): after the reference to the book number, this system includes an arabic numeral referring to the page of the edition of Casaubon followed by a letter (ranging from a to f) corresponding to the subdivision of the page into sections of about ten lines of text (e.g., *Deipn*. 12.530d).
* Kaibel reference system - this system was introduced by Georg Kaibel in his edition of the *Deipnosophists* [(1887-1890)](https://archive.org/details/athenaeinavcrati01atheuoft): in this system each book is logically divided into paragraphs corresponding to units of sense and the paragraphs are referred to with arabic numerals whose numeration starts again at the beginning of each book (e.g., *Deipn*. 12.40).

* Use the [Casaubon-Kaibel reference converter](http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/Casaubon-Kaibel_converter/) for automatically finding concordances between the two systems.
* An [Application Programming Interface (API)](http://digitalathenaeus.org/tools/Casaubon-Kaibel_converter/api.php) allows to integrate converter data into external services.
